"""Research tools for the deepagent.

Provides ``tavily_search`` (web discovery + full-page fetch as markdown)
and ``think_tool`` (no-op reflection sink used to slow the agent down
after each search). Mirrors the upstream
``langchain-ai/deepagents/examples/deep_research/research_agent/tools.py``
verbatim apart from the default ``max_results`` / ``topic`` values, which
are wired to cookiecutter variables so the user can tune at scaffold time.

    Use this tool after each search to analyze results and plan next steps

    When to use:
    - After receiving search results: What key information did I find?
    - Before deciding next steps: Do I have enough to answer comprehensively?
    - When assessing research gaps: What specific information am I still missing?
    - Before concluding research: Can I provide a complete answer now?

    Reflection should address:
    1. Analysis of current findings — What concrete information have I gathered?
    2. Gap assessment — What crucial information is still missing?
    3. Quality evaluation — Do I have sufficient evidence for a good answer?
    4. Strategic decision — Should I continue searching or provide my answer?

    Args:
        reflection: Detailed reflection on research progress, findings, gaps,
            and next steps.

        Confirmation that reflection was recorded for decision-making.
