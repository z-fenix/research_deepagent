description: "LangChain / LangGraph engineering pitfalls and verified fixes. Covers DeepAgents, structured output, OpenAI-compatible model integration (including Chinese provider adapters: DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, etc.), middleware, streaming, multi-agent orchestration, and other common development issues. Use when hitting unexpected behavior, making architecture decisions, or integrating Chinese LLM providers during LangChain development."

# LangChain Dev Guide

A systematic summary of typical issues, non-obvious behaviors, and verified solutions encountered in real engineering with the LangChain / LangGraph ecosystem. Every entry comes from a real development scenario and is organized by category.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This skill is an **engineering practice reference**, not an introductory tutorial. Each entry assumes the developer is already familiar with basic LangChain concepts (agent, tool, message, graph).

## How to Use

1. First use the "Scenario Index" below to locate the category file your problem belongs to.
2. When unsure which category applies, search keywords directly in the "Common Issues Quick Reference".
3. For ContextSeek / semantic memory: start with [contextseek-middleware.md](reference/contextseek-middleware.md) to identify your scenario, then go to [contextseek-params.md](reference/contextseek-params.md) for specific parameter configuration issues.
4. Once you find the relevant section, read it in depth — every entry follows the structure **Symptom → Cause → Solution → Lessons learned**.

## Scenario Index

| Category | File | Trigger Scenarios |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Deep Agents | [reference/deepagents.md](reference/deepagents.md) | Model selection, filesystem backend, disabling the general-purpose sub-agent, file permissions, long-term memory, long `SKILL.md` truncated by `read_file` 100-line default |
| Structured Output | [reference/structured-output.md](reference/structured-output.md) | Model-level method selection, `create_agent` strategies, missing fields, unsupported `tool_choice`, provider-side 400 errors on forced schema tool selection |
| OpenAI-compatible Model Integration | [reference/model-integration.md](reference/model-integration.md) | Pitfalls when using `ChatOpenAI` against OpenAI-compatible providers, integrating Reasoning models (chain-of-thought / `reasoning_content`) |
| CN Model Integration | [reference/cn-models/README.md](reference/cn-models/README.md) | Generating LangChain integration classes for Chinese providers (DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Moonshot) |
| Middleware | [reference/middleware.md](reference/middleware.md) | Middleware execution order, `state_schema` merging, HITL `resume` values, modifying state from `wrap_model_call` |
| Streaming Output | [reference/streaming.md](reference/streaming.md) | Choosing between `stream_events` and `stream`, distinguishing tokens from multiple LLMs, disabling streaming, custom progress events |
| Multi-Agent Orchestration | [reference/multi-agent.md](reference/multi-agent.md) | subagents vs handoffs, tool-per-agent vs dispatch, retrieving subagent state, trimming subagent boilerplate, quickly building handoff setups |
| Other Common Issues | [reference/common-issues.md](reference/common-issues.md) | High-frequency standalone issues that don't fit the categories above. Currently includes: tools returning data to both the model and the application layer, MCP tools unable to access runtime context, `invalid_tool_calls`, and dynamic system prompt placeholders |
| ContextSeek — Use Case Scenarios | [reference/contextseek-middleware.md](reference/contextseek-middleware.md) | Agent loses context across sessions, tool call auditing, cross-topic knowledge discovery (dream), SRE provenance / confidence tracing, enterprise knowledge cold-start (DataPlug) |
| ContextSeek — Parameter & Config Issues | [reference/contextseek-params.md](reference/contextseek-params.md) | scope isolation, auto_store / record_tool_calls write volume, auto_compact throttling and shutdown, retrieval_tags / min_score filtering, tool_arg_overrides, dream trigger conditions, dream item decay, evidence_chain vs chain_confidence, DataPlug vs ctx.add(), plug() scope priority, auto_dream dual-gate triggering |
